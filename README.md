# Installation

# Usage
Use MCM to configure the left and right nipple offset. You can enable a debug axis to make this step easier.
Use other parameters to adjust effect if desired.

The standalone nipple squirt effect can be toggled on/off via the key "K" (can be configured via MCM). This only works for the player actor. The effect can be toggled on/off at any time even when your character is not naked.

Works best with CBPC. 
With SMP nipple offset is somewhat off/delayed.

# OStim integration
If OStim is installed and integration is enabled in MCM, naked female actors will nipple squirt when spanked or on orgasm.

# Technical details
This mod was developed using the 3BA body and XPMSSE. The nipple squirt effect is attached to the bones named "L Breast03" and "R Breast03". I'm not quite sure where these bones come from (I assume XPMSSE) but they need to be present in the skeleton for the effect to be working correctly.

# Known issues
+ Does not work correctly in 1st person mode.
+ Particles look weird from some angles.
